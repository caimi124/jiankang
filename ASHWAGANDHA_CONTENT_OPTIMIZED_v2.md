## What is Ashwagandha?

**Ashwagandha** (*Withania somnifera*), also known as **Indian ginseng** or **winter cherry**, is one of the most powerful adaptogenic herbs in Ayurvedic medicine. For over 3,000 years, it has been used to help the body adapt to stress, restore energy, and support overall wellness.

### Why "Indian Ginseng"?

Although not related to true ginseng, ashwagandha shares similar adaptogenic properties that help:
- Combat physical and mental fatigue
- Enhance resilience to stress
- Support hormonal balance naturally

### Key Active Compounds

Ashwagandha's therapeutic effects come from bioactive compounds called **withanolides**, which work through multiple pathways:

| **Compound** | **Primary Function** |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Withanolides** | Stress hormone regulation (cortisol reduction) |
| **Withaferin A** | Anti-inflammatory & antioxidant protection |
| **Alkaloids** | Nervous system calming |
| **Saponins** | Energy metabolism support |

> **Scientific Fact:** A 2019 study published in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* found ashwagandha extract reduced cortisol levels by up to **27%** in chronically stressed adults.
